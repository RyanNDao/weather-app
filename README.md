## About
This project is a weather app that uses asynchronous calls to get live data from a weather API and from a gif database. The skills taught from this project mainly revolve around promises and processing data from APIs. 

## Features
- User can search for a city and the app displays the weather data for that location 
- Includes a fun gif at the bottom of the page that represents the weather
- Displays a loading screen when the weather API is called to prevent the user from interacting with the page
